# Linked List 2.5
Calculates the sum of two linked lists. Understandably there are better, more efficient ways to solve this same problem. This is simply a demonstration of how I was able to solve it.

I attempted multiple different solutions to this same question. I could not solve the problem fully so I attempted to implement some sort of solution to the question at hand and this was the closest I could get.
